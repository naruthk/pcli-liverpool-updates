# Liverpool F.C. (Soccer) - League, Scores, Updates using Command-Line-Interface

## Overview
Having been a Liverpool Football Club supporter for the past eight years, I wanted to share with all of you a "nerdy" way of looking up statistics for the Liverpool team, such as league standing, score reports, and players information. 

This command-line-interface application is written in Python, a programming language that I am currently self-studying for.

## Features

You can use the application to look up:
- List of competition names besides the one that Liverpool F.C. is in (Premier League)
- Fixtures over a specific number of days that you use as input
- Live score report
- League standing
- Players (Squad)
- News and updates about the team

## Installation

Clone this repository. Make sure you already have Python installed in your working computer. 

Then run, `pip install .`

## Usage

Type `cli-soccer -h` to see an overview of available commands.

To retrieve the fixtures for the next 20 days, type `cli-soccer --fixtures='20'`. Simply replace `20` with your number of choice.

To see the current league standing (updated live), type `cli-soccer --standings`. That's it!
